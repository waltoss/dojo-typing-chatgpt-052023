There is an awful bug 🐞 and my tests can't pass 😢
Can you find it ? I think it reminds me of something I already saw somewhere ...

I'm sick of having the same issue, and I'm afraid it will happen again. We have a huge backlog, and new junior developpers are coming ...
Do you have an idea to fix it **for good** ?

⚠️ You can only modify `src/AppEventModal.tsx`, everything else is working fine ...
