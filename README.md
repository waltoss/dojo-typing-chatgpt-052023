I just added a new page to my application that make a simple API call when I submit a form

But there is an awful bug 🐞 and my tests can't pass 😢 Can you find it ? I think it reminds me of something I already saw somewhere ...

Also I'm sick of having the same issue, and I'm afraid it will happen again. There is a new junior developer coming and I wan’t to make sure he won’t make the same mistake as I did ... Do you have an idea to fix it **for good** ?

⚠️ You can only modify `src/AppEventModal.tsx`, everything else is working fine ...
